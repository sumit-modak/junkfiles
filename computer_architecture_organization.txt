cache_design
    - block_placement : Where to place the main memory block in the cache?
    - block_identification : How to find the main memory block in the cache?
    - block_replacement : During a cache miss, how to choose which entry to replace from the cache?
        - cache_miss
            - capacity_miss : When the cache size is full?
            - compulsory_miss : When the main memory block is haven't accessed yet
            - conflict_miss : When the cache block is occupied by some other main memory block
